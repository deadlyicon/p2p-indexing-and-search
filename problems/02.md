# (2) Working With Append-Only Logs
Let's go ahead and get our feet wet with Hypercore and Hyperspace. Refer back to the [Welcome page](00.md) if you aren't comfortable with the idea of an append-only log.

In the following exercises, you'll create a few Hypercores and learn about the API by appending/getting some data.

Note that from here on out, we'll typically refer to Hypercores as "cores". If we're talking about general properties of append-only logs, we might refer to them as "logs".

## New Methods
* Hyperspace's [`corestore`](https://github.com/hypercore-protocol/hyperspace-client#corestore--clientcorestorenamespace): Creates a new Corestore instance.
* Corestore's [`get`](https://github.com/hypercore-protocol/hyperspace-client#feed--corestoregetkey): Get a Hypercore, or create a new one (if no options are passed in).
* Hypercore's `ready`: Make sure the Hypercore's state (it's key, for example) is loaded.
* Hypercore's [`append`](https://github.com/hypercore-protocol/hypercore#feedappenddata-callback): Append a new block, or an array of blocks, to a Hypercore.
* Hypercore's [`get`](https://github.com/hypercore-protocol/hypercore#const-id--feedgetindex-options-callback): Get the block at a specific index.

## Exercises

Hyperspace exposes append-only logs through the "Corestore" interface. Don't worry too much about what a Corestore is at this point. It's basically a Hypercore factory that makes it easy to assign names to cores, and retrieve them by name later, which is useful for these exercises.

```js
const store = c.corestore()

// Core is a Hypercore instance, which is an append-only log
const core = store.get({ name: 'exercise-02 '})

// Wait for internal state to load
await core.ready()

console.log(core) // Prints out details like the length of the core, byteLength, the public key etc.
```

#### Exercise 1

Run the above to see that you access a feed and print out info about it.
It should print something similar to

```js
{
  ...
  key: deadb...eef,
  peers: 0,
  length: 0,
  byteLength: 0,
}
```

#### Exercise 2

To interact with an append-only log there are four core concepts.

* Knowing what the public key of the log is so you can share it with other people.
* Appending a new block of data to the log (`core.append`).
* Getting a block of data from an index (`core.get`).
* Knowing how many blocks of data are in the log (`core.length`).

To append a block of data the Hypercore feed exposes the append method.

```js
await core.append('block #' + core.length)
```

Append a block of data to the core above.
Everytime you append you should see the `length` increase by one when printing it out.

#### Exercise 3

Now that we know how to append data and check how many blocks of data are in the core,
make a for loop that prints out all the data in the core.

You can use `block = await core.get(index)` to get a specific block of data out.

Make a for loop that prints out each block of data from the core.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < core.length; i++) {
  // print the block stored at i
}
```

Notice that the `core.get` api returns the block as a Node.js buffer.
If you want to turn that into a string you need to do `block.toString()` or do
`core.get(index, { valueEncoding: 'utf-8' })`

If your solution works it should print something like:

```
block #0
block #1
block #2
...
```
